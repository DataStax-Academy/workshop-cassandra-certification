### 1. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the CQL statements:
```
CREATE TABLE roller_coasters (
    name TEXT,
    park TEXT,
    rating INT,
    PRIMARY KEY((name))
);

INSERT INTO roller_coasters (name, park, rating) 
  VALUES ('Millenium Force', 'Cedar Point', 8 );

INSERT INTO roller_coasters (name, park, rating) 
  VALUES ('Formula Rossa', 'Ferrari World', 9 );

INSERT INTO roller_coasters (name, park, rating) 
  VALUES ('Steel Dragon 2000', 'Nagashima Spa Land', 10 );

INSERT INTO roller_coasters (name, park, rating) 
  VALUES ('Millenium Force', 'Cedar Point', 7 );
```

How many rows will the ``roller_coasters`` table have after executing all the CQL statements?

**A.** none

**B.** 2

**C.** 3

**D.** 4

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is C |
| :--- |
| The first and fourth ``INSERTS`` use the same primary key so they cause an *upsert*. Therefore only 3 rows are created. (see DS201 - *Clustering Columns*) |
</p>
</details>

### 2. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the CQL statements:
```
CREATE TABLE songs (
    artist TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    length_seconds INT,
    PRIMARY KEY((artist, title))
);

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title, length_seconds) 
  VALUES ('The Beatles', 'Yesterday', 123 );

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title, length_seconds) 
  VALUES ('The Beatles', 'Let It Be', 243 );

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title, length_seconds) 
  VALUES ('Abba', 'Fernando', 255 );

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title, length_seconds) 
  VALUES ('Frank Sinatra', 'Yesterday', 235 );
```

What is the result of executing all the CQL statements?

**A.** A table with 1 partition. 

**B.** A table with 2 partitions.

**C.** A table with 3 partitions.

**D.** A table with 4 partitions.

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is D |
| :--- |
| The partition key consists of ``artist`` *and* ``title`` (and its also the primary key btw). Each ``INSERT`` has a unique ``artist``/``title`` pair so there are no *upserts* and each ``INSERT`` results in a unique partition. (see DS201 - *Partitions*)|
</p>

### 3. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the CQL statement:
```
CREATE TABLE cars (
    make TEXT,
    model TEXT,
    year INT,
    color TEXT,
    cost INT,
    PRIMARY KEY ((make, model), year, color)
);
```

Which of the following is a valid query for the cars table?

**A.** 
```
SELECT * FROM cars 
  WHERE make='Ford';
```

**B.** 
```
SELECT * FROM cars 
  WHERE year = 1969 
  AND color = 'Red';
```

**C.** 
```
SELECT * FROM cars 
  WHERE make='Ford' 
  AND model = 'Mustang' 
  AND year = 1969;
```

**D.** 
```
SELECT * FROM cars 
  WHERE make='Ford' 
  AND model = 'Mustang' 
  AND color = 'Red';
```

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is C |
| :--- |
| The partition key consists of ``make`` *and* ``model`` so **A** and **B** are excluded because the ``WHERE`` clause does not include the partition key. **C** and **D** both include the partition key but clustering columns can only be *constrained* L-R in the order they appear in the primary key. Since ``year`` appears before ``color``, **C** is correct and **D** is excluded. (see DS201 - *Clustering Columns*)|
</p>

### 4. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the CQL statements:
```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id TEXT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);

CREATE TABLE employees_by_department (
    id TEXT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY ((department), id)
);

BEGIN BATCH
    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department) 
      VALUES ('AC1123', 'Joe', 'legal');

    INSERT INTO employees_by_department (id, name, department)
      VALUES ('AC1123', 'Joe', 'legal');
APPLY BATCH;
```
What is a valid statement about this batch?

**A.** It is a single-partition batch that can be applied.

**B.** It is a single-partition batch that cannot be applied.

**C.** It is a multi-partition batch that can be applied.

**D.** It is a multi-partition batch that cannot be applied.

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is C |
| :--- |
| The two ``INSERTS`` are into different tables which makes them different partitions. Even if one or both result in *upserts* there is nothing preventing this batch from being applied. |
</p>

### 5. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the table definition with a primary key omitted:
```
CREATE TABLE reviews_by_restaurant (
    name TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    reviewer TEXT,
    rating INT,
    comments TEXT,
    review_date TIMEUUID,
    PRIMARY KEY (...)
);
```
It is known that:
- Restaurant Reviews are uniquely identified by a combination of ``name``, ``city`` and ``reviewer``
- Restaurant Reviews are retrieved from the table using combination of ``name``, ``city``
- The table has multi-row partitions

What primary key does this table have?

**A.** 
```PRIMARY KEY((name), reviewer, city)```

**B.** 
```PRIMARY KEY((name, city), reviewer)```

**C.** 
```PRIMARY KEY((name, reviewer), city)```

**D.** 
```PRIMARY KEY(reviewer, name city)```

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is B |
| :--- |
| Since restaurant reviews are uniquely identified by a combination of ``name``, ``city`` and ``reviewer`` the primary key must include all three fields. 
Since restaurant reviews are retrieved from the table using combination of ``name`` and ``city``, these two fields must come before ``reviewer`` in the *primary key*. 
A primary key ``((name), city, reviewer)`` would also have worked fine, with the query selecting a (contiguous) part of a wider partition. (see DS201 - *Clustering Columns*)|
</p>

### 6. CQL - Developer Exam
Consider the table definition and the CQL query:
```
CREATE TABLE teams (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    wins INT,
    losses INT,
    ties INT
);

SELECT * FROM teams_by_wins WHERE wins = 4;
```
Which materialized view definition can be used to support the query?

**A.** 
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS
    teams_by_wins AS
    SELECT * FROM teams
      PRIMARY KEY((name), wins);
```
**B.**
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS
    teams_by_wins AS
    SELECT * FROM teams
      PRIMARY KEY((wins), name);
```
**C.**

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS
    teams_by_wins AS
    SELECT * FROM teams
      WHERE name IS NOT NULL AND wins IS NOT NULL
      PRIMARY KEY((name), wins);
```
**D.**
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS
    teams_by_wins AS
    SELECT * FROM teams
      WHERE wins IS NOT NULL AND name IS NOT NULL
      PRIMARY KEY((wins), name);
```

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is D |
|:---|
| Since primary key fields cannot be NULL the ``WHERE`` clause must include a *NULL check*. Since the ``WHERE`` clause in the ``SELECT`` is based on ``wins``, ``wins`` must be the partition key. |
</p>
</details>

### 7. CQL - Developer Exam
Consider the table definition and the CQL query:
```
CREATE TABLE restaurants_by_city (
    name TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    cuisine TEXT,
    price int,
    PRIMARY KEY ((city), name)
);

SELECT * FROM restaurants_by_city
  WHERE city = 'Sydney'
  AND cuisine = 'sushi';
```  
Which secondary index can be used to support the query?

**A.** 
```
CREATE INDEX cuisine_restaurants_by_city_2i
  ON restaurants_by_city (cuisine);
```
**B.**

```
CREATE INDEX cuisine_restaurants_by_city_2i
  ON restaurants_by_city (city, cuisine);
```
**C.**

```
CREATE INDEX cuisine_restaurants_by_city_2i
  ON restaurants_by_city (cuisine, city);
```
**D.**

```
CREATE INDEX cuisine_restaurants_by_city_2i
  ON restaurants_by_city (city, name, cuisine);
```
<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is A |
|:---|
| B, C, and D are incorrect because indexes on multiple columns are not supported. |
</p>
</details>

    PRIMARY KEY(id, email)
);
```
Which ``INSERT`` statement can be used to insert a row in the ``people`` table?

**A.**
```
INSERT INTO people (id, name, email) 
  VALUES (UUID(), {first:'foo', last:'bar'}, 'foo@datastax.com' );
```
**B.**
```
INSERT INTO people (id, name, email) 
  VALUES (UUID(), name: {'foo', 'bar'}, 'foo@datastax.com' );
```
**C.**
```
INSERT INTO people (id, name, email) 
  VALUES (UUID(), 'foo', 'bar', 'foo@datastax.com' );

### 10. CQL - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the CQL statements:
```
CREATE TABLE emails_by_user (
    username TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    nickname TEXT STATIC,
    PRIMARY KEY((username), email)
);

INSERT INTO emails_by_user (username, email, description, nickname) 
  VALUES ('dc1234', 'david@datastax.com', 'work', 'Dave');
  
INSERT INTO emails_by_user (username, email, description, nickname) 
  VALUES ('dc1234', 'david@gmail.com', 'personal', 'Dave');
  
UPDATE emails_by_user SET nickname = 'Davey', description = 'school' 
  WHERE username = 'dc1234' AND email = 'david@gmail.com';
  
SELECT * FROM emails_by_user WHERE username = 'dc1234';  
```
What is the result of executing these CQL statements?

**A.**
```
 username  | email              | nickname | description
-----------+--------------------+----------+-------------
    dc1234 | david@datastax.com |     Dave |        work
    dc1234 |    david@gmail.com |    Davey |      school
```
**B.**
```
 username  | email              | nickname | description
-----------+--------------------+----------+-------------
    dc1234 | david@datastax.com |    Davey |        work
    dc1234 |    david@gmail.com |    Davey |      school
```

**C.**
```
 username  | email              | nickname | description
-----------+--------------------+----------+-------------
    dc1234 |    david@gmail.com |    Davey |      school
```

**D.**
```
 username  | email              | nickname | description
-----------+--------------------+----------+-------------
    dc1234 | david@datastax.com |     Dave |        work
```
<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>

| The correct answer is B |
|:---|
| Because ``email`` is a clustering column the table has one partition with two rows . The ``nickname`` field is static so it was set to *Davey* for the entire partition.  |

### 11. Architecture - Developer and Administrator Exams
Consider the two datacenters in the diagram. ``TokyoDC`` has six nodes (two *failed* and four *active*) and a replication factor of 3, and ``ParisDC`` four nodes (one *failed* and three *active*) and a replication factor of 3.

![datacenters](images/5-4-failed.png)

What is a valid statement about a read request made at consistency level of ``LOCAL QUORUM`` to coordinator node ``Z`` in ``ParisDC``?

**A.** The request will be handled in data center ``ParisDC`` and will fail.

**B.** The request will be handled in data center ``ParisDC`` and will succeed.

**C.** The request will be retried in data center ``TokyoDC`` and will fail.

**D.** The request will be retried in data center ``TokyoDC`` and will succeed.

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>
    
| The correct answer is B |
|:---|
| ``LOCAL QUORUM`` requires a quorum (more than half) of the replicas in the *local data center* to respond in order to succeed. Since only 1 of 4 nodes in ``ParisDC`` have failed there will be at least 2 replicas available to handle the request. 2 is the quorum of 3, therefore the request will succeed. (see DS201 - *Consistency*)|

### 17. Read/Write/Storage - Administrator Exam
What is a valid statement about a coordinator node handling a query at consistency level ``THREE``?

**A.** The coordinator node sends a direct read request to all replicas.

**B.** The coordinator node sends a direct read request to three replicas.

**C.** The coordinator node sends a background read repair request to three replicas.

**D.** The coordinator node sends a direct read request to one replica and digest requests to two replicas.

<details><summary>Click to view the correct answer</summary>
<p>
    
| The correct answer is D |
|:---|
| The coordinator node only sends a *direct read* request to one node and sends *digest* request(s) to the remainder necessary to meet the consistency level. The coordinator node then compares the data read directly with the digest(s). If they agree the result is returned to the client. If they do not agree the most recent timestamped result is considered current and sent to the client. The coordinator node may need to request the latest timestamped version from a replica. |

|:---|
| In Chebotko Diagrams, a table lists clustering key columns in the order they appear in the primary key. If the clustering order is explicitly specified for a column in the ``WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY`` clause, the clustering order for all preceding clustering key columns must also be explicitly specified. |

![application workflow](images/investment-application.png)

Which access pattern(s) are evaluated before an application can evaluate access pattern Q3.2?

**A.** Q<sub>1</sub>

**B.** Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>

**C.** Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub>

**D.** Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub> and Q<sub>3.1</sub>

| The correct answer is A |
|:---|
| Q<sub>1</sub> is the entry point. After Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub> **or** Q<sub>3</sub> may be evaluated. Q<sub>3</sub> is broken down into Q<sub>3.1</sub> - Q<sub>3.5</sub>. The only prerequisite for Q<sub>3.1</sub> - Q<sub>3.5</sub> is Q<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, only Q<sub>1</sub> must be evaluated before  Q<sub>3.2</sub> |
