## 1. Why should I do this?
Stealing an excerpt from [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications)...

_The demand for Apache Cassandra™ and NoSQL skills is skyrocketing, with Cassandra developers commanding **31% higher salaries**, the highest of any database technology._

_**An Apache Cassandra™ Administrator Associate Certification** or **Apache Cassandra™ Developer Associate Certification** is the best way to get started learning and mastering the popular NoSQL database used by teams at Apple, Netflix, Sony, Uber, and thousands more._

_An official certification helps you gain confidence in your knowledge of Apache Cassandra™ and increases opportunities for career advancement._

## 2. Which certification?
Again, stealing from [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications)...

_The **Developer** Certification is designed for professionals that use Apache Cassandra clusters to manage data. This includes roles such as application developers, data architects, database designers, and database administrators._

_The **Administrator** Certification is designed for professionals who install, configure, manage and tune the performance of Apache Cassandra clusters, such as database administrators, DevOps engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)._

You can choose one path or do them both, it's up to you. Either way you'll level up your game and give your career an edge up to boot.

## 3. What steps do I need to take?

**✅ Step 1.** Go to [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications), read through the material, and take special note of the **Exam Rules and Process** section. 

**✅ Step 2.** Choose a **learning path**, either the **Developer** Certification or the **Administrator** Certification.

**✅ Step 3.** Go to [DataStax Academy](https://academy.datastax.com/) and sign up if you have not already done so. Academy is **FREE** along with all of the course content.

**✅ Step 4.** Based on the **learning path** you've chosen complete the course material within Academy. These links are provided for you in the **Learning Paths** section at [https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications](https://www.datastax.com/dev/certifications). You can also use the following links:

**✅ Step 4a.**
For the **administrator** path you will need courses [DS201](https://academy.datastax.com/#/online-courses/6167eee3-0575-4d88-9f80-f2270587ce23) and [DS210](https://academy.datastax.com/#/online-courses/b0ef552b-4f01-4e0e-ac17-6e7ce29ad6f0).

**OR**

**✅ Step 4b.**
For the **developer** path you will need courses [DS201](https://academy.datastax.com/#/online-courses/6167eee3-0575-4d88-9f80-f2270587ce23) and [DS220](https://academy.datastax.com/#/online-courses/ca2e1209-510b-44a6-97de-d5219d835319).

At a minimum you will need to watch **ALL** course videos and comfortably **pass practice quizzes** for each course based on your **learning path**.

In some cases virtual machines are provided that provide exercises and go into significantly more detail on the same topics covered in the videos. **While these are highly recommended they are not absolutely required to pass the exams**. 

_Note: The VMs can be pretty large both in size and resources for some laptops. You may want to consider our free Katacoda courses as an option, however, these scenarios don't cover ALL material from the Academy courses just yet._

_For Katacoda, use [https://www.datastax.com/learning-series/cassandra-fundamentals](https://www.datastax.com/learning-series/cassandra-fundamentals) for **DS201** and [https://katacoda.com/datastax/courses/cassandra-data-modeling](https://katacoda.com/datastax/courses/cassandra-data-modeling) for **DS220**. Again, these don't cover **ALL** of the material the exercise VMs do, but are a great alternative if VMs arent an option._

**✅ Step 5.** Get your exam voucher. 

Seriously, once you complete either the **administrator** or **developer** learning paths within Academy email **academy@datastax.com** using the same email associated with your Academy account and the subject ```Certification workshop voucher```. Be sure to let us know which learning path you've chosen. 

You will be allowed **ONE** voucher per **learning path**. Subsequent exam runs will not qualify for another voucher.

**✅ Step 6.** Take your exam.

**✅ Step 7.** Celebrate, shout from the rooftoops, and don't forget to add your badge to LinkedIn.

## 4. Practice questions
As part of this workshop we have provided a set of 20 practice questions that span DS201, DS220, and DS210 material. These questions use the same style and form you can expect in the actual exams and will give you an idea of what to expect. 

We highly suggest you run through these and test yourself. Each question will have a hidden answer. Try and answer them first before revealing the solution.
